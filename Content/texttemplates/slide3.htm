    <p>This is a simplified Sequence diagram showing the basic interaction between the actor/initiatior and the flow of the basic message to the datastore.</p>
           <p>This is a basic one-way message from the method inside the controller class. The method is decorated with a c# attribute which hides the implementation of the audit logging. Any method decorated with the attribute will activate the sequence. The context in which the attribute is used will give access to the data object that is seriialize to JSON and inserted into the document database.</p>
